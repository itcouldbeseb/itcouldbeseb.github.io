### Hello!

Welcome to the first post of (hopefully) many to come here on sebscape.net! This blog aims to chronicle and host my various projects, primarily in the realm of wargaming. I'm planning on posting hobby progress, battle reports, and other personal projects as I see fit.

This blog was created using [blag][blag_github], a static site generator written in Python that uses Jinja2 templates and Markdown to make writing posts and creating pages simple. If you're reading this shortly after this goes live, keep in mind that the layout and CSS theming is still very much a work in progress, and I'm aiming for an early 2000's, late Web 1.0 aesthetic.

As far as upcoming projects go, here's what's on my plate for the next few months:

* 3rd/4th Edition Space Wolves
* Revisiting existing armies
  * Undead
  * Goblins
* Starting a Mordheim campaign with friends
* Learning to sculpt
* OPR Regiments [War on Hunger: Charity Tournament][war_on_hunger] put on by my good friend [Ian][portcullis] happening on Oct 11th at The Crypt in Providence, RI.

I'm hoping that this blog will further motivate me to not only finish projects, but document and share them too. I was never very intersted in posting on Instagram, so we'll give this a shot instead ;)

Until next time,

-Seb
